A GUI calculator built using Python‚Äôs Tkinter module that allows users to interact using buttons for performing mathematical operations. For more detailed information (with images/screenshots), read the <a href="https://github.com/Viztruth/Scientific-GUI-Calculator-FULL-CODE/blob/main/About.pdf">`About File (PDF)`</a>.

<h3><b>Supports both ScientiÔ¨Åc and Standard mode.</b></h3>

The **_Standard mode_** performs the basic types of calculations such as multiplication, addition, subtraction, division, square root, and percentage calculations.

The **_ScientiÔ¨Åc mode_** performs all the operations of the standard mode along with logarithmic and trigonometric functions!
